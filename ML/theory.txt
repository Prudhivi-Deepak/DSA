Text-to-Image Generation: Complete Overview

1. Overview of Text-to-Image Generation

Text-to-Image (T2I) generation transforms natural language descriptions into realistic images using deep learning. Core stages include data preparation, training, evaluation, and inference.

2. Categories of Text-to-Image Models

A. Diffusion Models

Examples: DALL·E 2, Stable Diffusion, Imagen (Google)

Flow & Data Transformations:

Input: Text prompt (e.g., "A sunset over mountains")

Representation: Tokenized text → embeddings via CLIP/T5.

Noise Sampling: Gaussian noise image as starting point.

Training Loop:

Forward Diffusion: Gradually add noise to real images.

Reverse Denoising: Model learns to predict noise at each timestep.

Loss: MSE between predicted and true noise.

Inference:

Start from pure noise → iteratively denoise conditioned on text embeddings.

Output: Final high-fidelity image.

Testing & Evaluation:

Metrics: FID, CLIP Score, User studies.

Compare generated vs. real images.

Pros/Cons: High quality but compute-intensive.

B. Autoregressive Models

Examples: DALL·E 1, CogView

Flow & Data Transformations:

Input: Text prompt → token sequence.

Tokenization: Both text and images discretized via VQ-VAE into tokens.

Training Loop:

Transformer predicts next token in joint text-image sequence.

Loss: Cross-entropy on token prediction.

Inference:

Given text tokens, sample image tokens sequentially.

Reconstruct image via decoder.

Output: Lower-resolution image from tokens.

Testing & Evaluation:

Perplexity on held-out sequences.

Visual quality metrics (IS, FID).

Pros/Cons: Captures sequence structure; slower and resolution-limited.

C. GAN-Based Models

Examples: AttnGAN, StackGAN

Flow & Data Transformations:

Input: Text prompt → encoded vector (RNN/transformer).

Generator: Produces image from noise + text vector.

Discriminator: Judges real vs. fake, conditioned on text.

Training Loop:

Generator Loss: Fool discriminator + matching text-image features.

Discriminator Loss: Correct classification.

Inference:

Sample noise + text → Generator → Output: Synthesized image.

Testing & Evaluation:

GAN metrics (FID), diversity scores.

Pros/Cons: Fast but prone to mode collapse.

3. Building & Training Your Own Model

A. Data Preparation

Collect Dataset: COCO, LAION-5B, CUB birds.

Preprocessing:

Text: Clean, tokenize.

Images: Resize, normalize, (for diffusion) convert to latent.

Split: Train/validation/test sets.

B. Training Steps (Example: Diffusion)

Text Encoder Training (Optional): Fine-tune CLIP on paired data.

Diffusion Model Training:

Use U-Net backbone.

Loss: Predict noise at timesteps.

Monitor training loss, validation FID.

Checkpointing & Early Stopping.

C. Evaluation & Testing

Quantitative: Compute FID, IS, CLIP Score on test set.

Qualitative: Human evaluation on sample prompts.

Ablation Studies: Vary architecture or conditioning.

D. Deployment & Inference

Sampling: Choose steps vs. speed trade-off.

API/UI: Wrap model in service.

Monitoring: Track quality drift, feedback.
